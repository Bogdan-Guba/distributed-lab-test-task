# Distributed Lab Test Task – Android

An Android application developed as a technical assessment for Distributed Lab. This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern mobile architecture, robust networking, and clean UI/UX principles.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this task was to build a reliable and scalable Android application that interacts with a REST API, focusing on:

- **Performance:** Efficient data handling and UI rendering.
- **Maintainability:** Separation of concerns using Clean Architecture.
- **Scalability:** Easily extendable codebase for future features.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- **Networking:** Retrofit 2
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Clean Architecture principles
- **Local Storage:** Room Database

## 🏗 Architecture

The project is structured into layers to ensure high testability and independence from external libraries:

- **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic, use cases, and entity models (pure Kotlin).
- **Data Layer:** Implements repositories and handles data sources (API, database).
- **Presentation Layer:** MVVM pattern handling UI state and user interactions.
